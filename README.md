# Fizz Buzz

This is a simple little JavaScript script for Fizz Buzz, a famous programming problem. I created it back in October 2020, but I'm only uploading it now as I go through all my old code projects. Here is an except from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) about this scenerio:

> The player designated to go first says the number "1", and the players then count upwards in turn. However, any number divisible by three is replaced by the word fizz and any number divisible by five by the word buzz. Numbers divisible by 15 become fizz buzz.
